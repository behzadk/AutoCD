## Config file was used to generate model space for two strain experiments
# Model space contains two strains, two QS (AHLs) and two bacteriocins. 
# model space limits are each strain can express a maximum of one bacteriocin,
# and one QS. Each strain is sensitive to up to one bacteriocin in the system.
