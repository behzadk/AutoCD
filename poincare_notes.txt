Real projective space is the topological space of lines passing through the origin in
R^(n+1)
e.g RP^(1) is a circle

Recurrance plot:
Repicts when a simulation revisits a state that it has been in, in the past.
Time 0,0 line is always solid because comparing time zero and time zero, the state is the same

2-5% of points should be recurrances? Used for setting the threshold

The lengths of diagonal lines in an RP are directly related to the ratio of determinism or predictability inherent to the system.

	Recurrence Rate - How intensely a system visits the same states over time
	Proportion of points marked as an occurance. Continuous data this should be constrained to
	a fixed rate to understand the plot structure. So, fix RR to 2-5%.

	Determinisim - Assesses the degree to which a systems dynamics are predictable
	Evident from the presence of diagonal lines parallel to the central diagonal.
	DET is a measurement of the proportion of recurrent points that form these diagonal lines.
	Requires a definition of how many points constitute a line

	Entropy - How complex the deterministic structure is. High entropy implies complex patterns,
	many diagonal lines of different lengths.
